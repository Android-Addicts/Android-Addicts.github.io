  "body": "### Welcome to Kang-Bang!\r\nWhat is Kang-Bang?  It's a group of android contributors who help one another with compiling unofficial android builds for Nexus devices.  We do a bunch of other things too like help each other learn to use git tools, gerrit etc., but compiling ROMs is mostly what we're about.\r\n\r\n### What's the name all about?\r\nWe're going to steal all yo shit!  Haha!  Git police, you can unpucker your sphincter!  We're actually insistent that members are very careful about authorship.  In fact, poor authorship is the express line if you want booted from the group!  Outside of that we're a pretty chill group.\r\n\r\n### What are the requirements to join?\r\nWell it's primarily a chat group, so there really isn't a meaningful requirement.\r\n\r\n### How do I get help compiling ROMs?\r\nWe can help you port device trees and kernel for any ROM, but you gotta have your shit in order first.\r\n1. Have a functioning Linux distro installed on a PC\r\n2. Successfully compile and flash a working build of SOME ROM for some sort of device.  \r\nSomeone MIGHT help you without having met the above requirements, but I wouldn't count on it.\r\n\r\n### What do we expect from you?\r\nRespect the wishes of ROM teams - If Omni or some other team does not want unofficial builds out in the wild, don't put your builds in a place where they can be downloaded by the general public.\r\nKeep your authorship straight!\r\n",
