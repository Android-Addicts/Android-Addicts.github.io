  "body": "### Welcome to Android-Addicts!\r\nWhat is Android-Addicts?  It's a group of android contributors who help one another with compiling unofficial android builds for Nexus devices.  We do a bunch of other things too like help each other learn to use git tools, gerrit etc., but compiling ROMs is mostly what we're about.\r\n\r\n### What are the requirements to join?\r\nWell it's primarily a chat group, so there really isn't a meaningful requirement.\r\n\r\n### How do I get help compiling ROMs?\r\nWe can help you port device trees and kernel for any ROM, but you gotta have your shit in order first.\r\n1. Have a functioning Linux distro installed on a PC\r\n2. Successfully compile and flash a working build of SOME ROM for some sort of device.  \r\nSomeone MIGHT help you without having met the above requirements, but I wouldn't count on it.\r\n\r\n### What do we expect from you?\r\nRespect the wishes of ROM teams - If Omni or some other team does not want unofficial builds out in the wild, don't put your builds in a place where they can be downloaded by the general public.\r\nKeep your authorship straight!\r\n",
